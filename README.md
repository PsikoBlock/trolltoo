# trolltoo
An ebuild overlay for Gentoo, containing ebuilds I built (usually because I couldn't find an ebuild in another overlay), and ebuilds from other overlays (because I'm not very handy with the masking of what I don't need from them).

To add with Layman:
you@yourprompthere # layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dallenwilson/trolltoo/master/overlay.xml -f -a trolltoo
